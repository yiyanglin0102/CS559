## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

This is the `QUESTIONS.md` file created for the examples we provided with the assignment. It's meant to give you an idea of the format. This assignment doesn't meet the minimum requirements (so it wouldn't get a great grade).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A: Helicopter flies, lands at a helipad, takes off, chooses a destination and flies there.
2.B: Cars and cubes drives around the track.
2.C:
2.D:
2.E:

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?

There is no spline track.

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is ridable?

Yes, the cubes, helicopter and race car are rideable with reasonable camera positions.

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.

List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1-3 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):

7: The helicopter flies, lands at its destination, takes off, chooses a new destination and flies there. The helicopter can be ridden or followed.


## Assignment 12

Object Diversity: List 8 of the different kinds of objects that appear in your world. If you made more than 8 kinds of objects, only list the 8 that are most interesting visually.

O.1 Helicopter
O.2 Helipad
O.3 Race Track
O.4 Race Car
O.5 Racing Cube (it's a simple cube with a behavior)
O.6 House
O.7
O.8

Object Diversity: list one object in your world that is loaded from a model file (e.g., OBJ or FBX). Remember to give proper attribution in your README file, and to include the object in your repository.

The race car is loaded from an FBX file obtained on the web. (see the README)

Object Diversity: list one of each category
Building: House
Natural Element:
Vehicle (object meant to move): Helicopter, Race Car

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challenge, a description of what you did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".

(none)

(example - even though it's not in the code)
6: A dynamic texture map is used to create an environment map (using the CubeCamera), which is used to create the reflections in the shiny sculpture in the middle of the world. To see this, look at the sculpture and see the moving reflections.

Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.

No, I did not place any pictures (since this is the example assignment).

Consent: do you agree to allow us to use your pictures in future gallery pages? (please answer Yes or No)

Yes
