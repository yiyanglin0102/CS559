## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example `QUESTIONS.md` file is in the `Examples` directory (QUESTIONS-example.md).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A:
2.B:
2.C:
2.D:
2.E:

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is ridable?

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.

List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challenge, a description of what you did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".

Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.
